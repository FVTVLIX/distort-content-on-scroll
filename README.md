# distort-content-on-scroll

## Description 

This project displays a skew effect on page scroll. These were all done by manipulating the DOM to add the skew effect. This animation style works really well on laptop mouse pads, it's a bit rough on scroll wheels. It's a smooth skew effect with a slow scroll.
